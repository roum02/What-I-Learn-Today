### 1. What is the Variable?
> A variable is a location in memory where a value is stored.

Now, let's explore how a computer calculates values.

A computer uses the **CPU** for calculations and stores data in **memory**.

**memory**
the memory is a set of memory cells, with each cell having a size of 1-byte(8-bit).

Therefore, a computer writes or saves data in 1-byte increments. 

Each of the memory cells has its own unique memory address composed of binary numbers.

```javascript
console.log(10+20)
```
The computer save the numbers (10 and 20) in specific memory addresses. The CPU later reads these numbers from their respective memory addresses and performs calculations.
